# palindrome_checker

A palindrome checker that removes punctuation and spaces before checker if the input is a palindrome. Type a text into the top box and press the button to see the output appear in the second box.
This project is coded in HTML, CSS and JS.
I would like to improve the styling, as it is currently quite basic.

You can run the website by using the html previewer of GitHub or by going to my portfolio, which is on my GitHub, and clicking on the link there.

This project was done following _[Free Code Camp](https://www.freecodecamp.org)_
